# Analyzing Naruto Series with NLP
In this project we are going to analyze a series with NLP and LLMs. We are going to scrape our own dataset, use zero shot classifiers, build our own LLM text classifier and used NER to build a character network.

## Overview
In this project, we have created 4 models, each containing the code for a different part of the project:
      
**crawler**: This folder contains the code for web scraping the internet to build a comprehensive dataset about the anime using Scrapy.

**character_network**: This folder contains the code for creating an intricate character network using Spacy's NER model, NetworkX, and PyViz.

**text_classifier**: This folder contains the code for training a text classifier that can classify text into multiple classes.

**theme_classifier**: This folder contains the code for extracting the main themes of the series using Zero-shot classifiers.
